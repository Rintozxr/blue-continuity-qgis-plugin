# landuse-continuity-qgis-plugin
lightweight QGIS plugin aims to assist with land-use continuity detection in historically layered urban areas, especially near blue infrastructures such as canals and rivers.

Introduction: In urban research, understanding the continuity of land parcel forms is critical for revealing how infrastructure and health-supportive environments evolve over time. This lightweight plugin provides an efficient way to detect and visualize long-term land-use continuity by comparing historical maps across different periods. The plugin automatically identifies areas of stability and change, helping researchers capture patterns of urban transformation quickly and intuitively. By supporting the rapid recognition of spatial dynamics, this tool offers valuable assistance for studies on urban development and health-oriented planning.
